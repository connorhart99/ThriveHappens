We want to empower people to Thrive in all and any aspects of their life, regardless of  the challenges they are facing. At home, at work, on the sports pitch, during periods pre and post illness, it is possible to Thrive.

Scott Hanley was diagnosed with Parkinsons Disease in 2017 , age 51. All signposts pointed to an incurable, degenerative, neurological disease which only ends up in one place. And the journey and end place are grim.

In October 2021 Scott was symptom free. Mental choices , shift in expectations, cognitively intense exercise and lifestyle changes proved conventional reasoning wrong. And he’s not alone.

Thrive Happens, even when sh*t happens ( which it will )
